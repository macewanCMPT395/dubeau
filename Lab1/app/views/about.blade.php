	    <p> This website is a community forum for discussions on the current generation of video game consoles.
	    Users can post about anything, so long as it is related to the current board.</p> <p>Guests will not be able to post
	    on the boards but will be able to see the discussions being held. This website is meant to be non-serious 
	    and relaxing, so we've come up with a few rules to ensure this.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Rules</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Keep posts on topic.</li>
	    <li>No Profanity</li>
	    <li>Don't argue for the sake of it. We want constructive discussion</li>
	    <li>No flame wars between consoles. We have multiple boards for a reason</li>
	    <li>All tributes to the gods must be done outside, and with a proper sacrifice.</li>
	    <li>Turn your blinker off if you aren't turning. It just confuses other drivers</li>
	    <li>No horseplay. I don't wanna have to call an ambulance.</li>
	    <li>No running in the pool area.</li>
	    <li>All flashbacks must be accompanied by soft music and sepia tone. I will get on your case about this.</li>
	    <li>Spammers will get the axe. Not banned, I will literally throw an axe through the screen at you.</li>
	    <li>If this is your first night at fight club, you must fight.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>If you are caught breaking these rules, we'll delete your account. Just don't do it.</h4></p>
